# IToolbox - Organizational Structure

**Company:** IToolbox  
**Founded:** 2019  
**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Version:** 1.1

## Multi-Industry Strategy

### Organizational Approach

IToolbox serves **multiple industries** (Environmental, Education, Healthcare, Fintech, Agriculture, Logistics, Manufacturing) with a **functional organizational structure** rather than industry-specific verticals.

**Why Functional vs. Industry Verticals?**

✅ **Early Stage (Current - 2027):**
- **Functional structure** (CTO builds all products, Sales sells to all industries)
- More efficient with limited resources
- Allows product portfolio diversity
- Team members develop cross-industry expertise
- Less overhead, faster decision-making

❌ **Industry Verticals** (Too early):
- Requires separate teams per industry
- Each vertical needs dedicated resources
- Higher operational costs
- Fragments focus and expertise

**Future Evolution:**
As we scale (Series A+), account managers may **organically specialize** by industry based on deals closed, eventually leading to dedicated vertical leaders.
